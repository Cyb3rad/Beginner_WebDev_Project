            <p class="questions">Zeus is ironically named, as he is a very small, Yorkshire Terrier/Miniature Poodle mix. He is my shadow, as he follows me around the house wherever I go. I love it! He is such a great companion and <b>LOVES</b> to play with his toys. He loves frisbees, any toys with squeekers, which he loves to chew out and destroy. Haha!</p>
            <p class="questions">Zeus was an accidental find. We were definitely not looking for a third dog, but the circuymstances were too good to pass up. For one, we needed to complete our small (Zeus), medium (Lacy), and large (huckleberry) trio. A co-worker of my wife's had recently bought her elderly mother a pup to keep her company, but as it turned out, he was just too energetic for her mother to keep up with. So, the girl sent my wife a picture and at first glance, we immediately said yes! No way were going to pass up on this adorable pup. He could fit on a dinner plate! haha!</p>
            <p class="questions">Zeus is so entertaining and we are so glad he joined our family!</p>

            <p>Huckleberry was named after one of my favorite movies of all time. I typically do not like westerns, but Tombstone is such an awesome movie with a spectacular cast. For me, it was Val Kilmer, as Doc Holliday, that really stood out to me, but Kurt Russel was pretty awesome, too.</p>
            <p>"I'm your Huckleberry!" - Doc Holliday</p>
            <p>Huckleberry was a rescue dog. We have always loved Labs and saw a listing in the classifieds for a 6-month old black lab mix that needed a home. The person selling the dog claimed he was a rescue but as it turned out, we may have rescued him from her. When we got him, he was <b>INFESTED</b> with deer ticks.</p>
            <p>Now he has a loving home, and is one of the sweetest dogs we've ever had!</p>

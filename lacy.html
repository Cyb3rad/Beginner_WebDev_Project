            <p class="questions">We found Lacy at the SPCA on a day my family, and I only intended to look at the cute dogs. Little did we know, that was the day we would bring Lacy home with us. She was nervous and slightly timid but oh so sweet. One of the greatest parts of us getting Lacy, was that my oldest daughter, was visiting us from PA! To this day, when she comes to visit, Lacy doesn't leave her side! You can tell she definitely remembers her every single time, regardless of how long it has been since she has seen her.</p>
            <p class="questions">From day one, she has been the sweetest, most loving dog ever! We used to live on 2 acres, and one of the things that used to be so awesome to watch was when she would speed through the snow at lightning speeds. She would literally make us dizzy as we laughed so hard following her in circles around us. Every now and then, she would drop her haw and scoop up some snow like it was a snowcone.</p>
            <p class="questions">Lacy is such a happy dog, and we just love her playful personality, especially when playing with the other two dogs. Huckleberry and Lacy actually team up on Zeus, but he loves it, and it's so fun to watch!</p>
